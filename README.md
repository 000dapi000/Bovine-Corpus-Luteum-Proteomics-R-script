This R code was used for the proteomics data analysis presented in the paper “Bovine Corpus Luteum Proteomics during Different Reproductive and Physiological Stages” by Granit Thaqi et al. (2025). Please refer to the paper for further details.
Steps:
1. Change the local file path in lines 5 and 1242 of the R script.
2. Extract the file "RAW proteinGroups with FASTA file_Bovine_proteomics.zip".
3. Place the extracted files into your local file path.
4. Verify that the following files are located in the correct path:
   FASTA_uniprotkb_taxonomy_id_9913_Bovine.tsv
   RAW_P337_02B_proteinGroups.txt
   Also, check that the paths specified in lines 5 and 1242 match.
5. Run the R code.
